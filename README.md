## 100 Days of Code Challenge:

💭 I got inspired by Brittany Walker's Code like a Girl's blog detailing her journey taking on the challange and wanted to document my own journey covering CSS, HTML, JavaScript and various libraries and frameworks along the way.

## Week 1

### Day 1. Bear Cub 🐻

This took a few shapes, positioning, and learning the importance of `z-index`.

Here's Buddy, the bear! My first stab at creating an animal with pure HTML and CSS.

The link to my codepen project can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/soniaweb/pen/bGwBJYj?editors=1100">here</a>. I really welcome anyone reading this to fork and see if you can build off of it. 👍

### Day 2. Elephant 🐘
Michael's original challenge focused on creating just the face and if we wanted to challenge ourselves, we could add whatever we liked. The link to my codepen project can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/soniaweb/pen/RwGKaKB?editors=1100">here</a>.
